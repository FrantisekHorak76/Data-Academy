1) Data analyse of product price and payroll with SQL
  A) The file ProjectSQL - DataBases.sql creates data for research questions  
  B) The file ProjectSQL - ResearchQuestions answers research questions
    - Have wages risen in all sectors over the years, or have they fallen in some?
    - How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought for the first 
      and last comparable period in the available price and wage data?
    - Which food category is the most expensive (it has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?
    - Is there a year in which the year-on-year rise in food prices was significantly higher than the rise in wages 
      (greater than 10%)?
    - Does GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or if GDP rises more sharply in one year, 
      will food prices or wages increase significantly in the same or the following year?
